	abstract = {The nitrogen vacancy and some nickel related defects in diamond can be observed as single quantum systems in diamond by their fluorescence. The fabrication of single colour centres occurs via generation of vacancies or via controlled nitrogen implantation in the case of the nitrogen vacancy (NV) centre. The NV centre shows an electron paramagnetic ground and optically excited state. As a result electron and nuclear magnetic resonance can be carried out on single defects. Due to the localized nature of the electron spin wavefunction hyperfine coupling to nuclei more than one lattice constant away from the defect as dominated by dipolar interaction. As a consequence the coupling to close nuclei leads to a splitting in the spectrum which allows for optically detected electron nuclear double resonance. The contribution discusses the physics of the NV and other defect centre from the perspective of single defect centre spectroscopy. (© 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

	abstract = {The nitrogen–vacancy centre (NV) has drawn much attention for over a decade, yet detailed knowledge of the photophysics needs to be established. Under typical conditions, the NV can have two stable charge states, negative (NV − ) or neutral (NV 0 ), with photo-induced interconversion of these two states. Here, we present detailed studies of the ionization dynamics of single NV centres in bulk diamond at room temperature during illumination and its dependence on the excitation wavelength and power. We apply a recent method which allows us to directly measure the charge state of a single NV centre, and observe its temporal evolution. We find that the steady-state NV − population is always ⩽75\% for 450–610 nm excitation wavelength. In combination with saturation measurements, we show that the optimal excitation wavelength is around 510–540 nm. Furthermore, the relative absorption cross-section of NV − is determined for 540–610 nm, revealing a double-peak structure. Finally, the energy of the NV − ground state of 2.6 eV below the conduction band is measured. These results reveal new insights into the charge state dynamics of the NV centre.},

We show that resonant conversion of NV0 to NV− significantly improves spectral stability of the NV− defect and allows high fidelity initialization of the spin qubit. Based on density functional theory calculations a novel mechanism involving an Auger ionization of NV− and charge transfer of an electron from the valence band to NV0 is discussed.

	abstract = {Crystal defects in diamond have emerged as unique objects for a variety of applications, both because they are very stable and because they have interesting optical properties. Embedded in nanocrystals, they can serve, for example, as robust single-photon sources or as fluorescent biomarkers of unlimited photostability and low cytotoxicity. The most fascinating aspect, however, is the ability of some crystal defects, most prominently the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, to locally detect and measure a number of physical quantities, such as magnetic and electric fields. This metrology capacity is based on the quantum mechanical interactions of the defect's spin state. In this review, we introduce the new and rapidly evolving field of nanoscale sensing based on single NV centers in diamond. We give a concise overview of the basic properties of diamond, from synthesis to electronic and magnetic properties of embedded NV centers. We describe in detail how single NV centers can be harnessed for nanoscale sensing, including the physical quantities that may be detected, expected sensitivities, and the most common measurement protocols. We conclude by highlighting a number of the diverse and exciting applications that may be enabled by these novel sensors, ranging from measurements of ion concentrations and membrane potentials to nanoscale thermometry and single-spin nuclear magnetic resonance.},

In this paper uniaxial stress experiments are described which show the band to be a transition between A\$\_\{1\}\$ (ground) and E (excited) electronic states of a trigonal centre, the E state being coupled predominantly to A\$\_\{1\}\$ modes of vibration. Annealing experiments suggest that the centre is either a substitutional nitrogen atom plus an interstitial nitrogen atom, or a substitutional nitrogen atom plus a vacancy. Small differences between the luminescence and absorption bands are shown to be consistent with the double minima vibrational potential of the nitrogen-vacancy model.},

T1 was studied as a function of temperature from 5 to 475 K and magnetic field from 0 to 630 G for several samples with various NV and nitrogen concentrations. Our studies reveal three processes responsible for T1 relaxation. Above room temperature, a two-phonon Raman process dominates; below room temperature, we observe an Orbach-type process with an activation energy of 73(4) meV, which closely matches the local vibrational modes of the NV center. At yet lower temperatures, sample dependent cross-relaxation processes dominate, resulting in temperature independent values of T1 from milliseconds to minutes. The value of T1 in this limit depends sensitively on the magnetic field and can be tuned by more than 1 order of magnitude.},

Where the luminescence is expected to approach a maximum value asymptotically, we have found that it instead drops by as much as a factor of two. In this report, we present evidence that these effects are caused by optical spin depolarization of the NV− center. We show that the presence of an external magnetic field results in a marked decrease in the anomalous character of the NV− centers’ luminescence and demonstrate that low-energy pulses applied after a strong depolarizing pulse can repolarize the spin of the center. We also offer a model and derive important parameters describing dynamics in the NV center and its interaction with light, which quantitatively explain all the observations.},

	abstract = {Diamond nanocrystals containing nitrogen–vacancy (NV) color centers have been used in recent years as fluorescent probes for near-field and cellular imaging. In this work, we report that an infrared (IR) pulsed excitation beam can quench the photoluminescence of a NV color center in a diamond nanocrystal (size {\textless}50 nm) with an extinction ratio as high as ≈90\%. We attribute this effect to the heating of the nanocrystal consecutive to multi-photon absorption by the diamond matrix. This quenching is reversible: the photoluminescence intensity goes back to its original value when the IR laser beam is turned off, with a typical response time of 100 ps, allowing for fast control of NV color center photoluminescence. We used this effect to achieve the sub-diffraction-limited imaging of fluorescent diamond nanocrystals on a coverglass. For that, as in the ground state depletion super-resolution technique, we combined the green excitation laser beam with the control IR depleting one after shaping its intensity profile in a doughnut form, so that the emission comes only from the sub-wavelength size central part.},

	abstract = {The much sought after optical transistor—the photonic counterpart of the electronic transistor—is poised to become a central ingredient in the development of optical signal processing. The motivation for using photons rather than electrons comes not only from their faster dynamics, but also from their lower crosstalk and robustness against environmental decoherence, which enable a high degree of integration and the realization of quantum operations. A single-molecule transistor has recently been demonstrated at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we demonstrate that a single nitrogen–vacancy centre at room temperature can operate as an optical switch under non-resonant continuous-wave illumination. We show an optical modulation of more than 80\% and a time response faster than 100 ns in the green-laser-driven fluorescence signal, which we control through an independent near-infrared gating laser. Our study indicates that the near-infrared laser triggers a fast-decay channel of the nitrogen–vacancy mediated by promotion of the excited state to a dark band.},
