Parts of the Model.
Current understanding of the NV centre under green excitation.
Show ground and excited spin triplets as well as two singlet states.
Spin conserving excitation:
Fluorescence Lifetime, (2x in nanodiamonds compared to bulk):
Spin Polarising Singlet state, Rates to singlet state:
Spin Polarising Singlet state rate from ground singlet to ground triplet, some say all to ms = 0 some say it is more varied than that:
If you use just these rates you can fit the fluorescence quite well and we have two fitting parameters to relate excitation and max counts:

Whilst there is a non zero overlap between the zero-phonon line and wavelength for 780nm there may be stimulated emmision. Using the STED or thirld level model breaks down due to a few reasons. 
30% of the NV's are in the NV0 configuration and we are collecting both NV0 and NV- fluorescence and this model does not describe the quenching of NV0.
And secondly the best fits using this model does not work.

In order to understand the fluorescence we investigated the effect of the NV0 and added the enery levels to our model.
The NV- ionises towards the NV0 ground state through an Auger ionisation process:
The NV0 recombines to the NV- by exciting an electron and recombining an electron from the valence band: (May include the singlets state ionisation)

It is important to note here that green excitation light ~532nm light is used as it gives the largest ratio between the recombination rate and the ionisation rate leading to a ~70 spin polarisation.
It has been observed that exciting with either 575nm or 637nm at the zero phonon line will push the charge state polarisation highly to the non pumped charge state.

We can assume that the repump into the ground triplet of the NV- state must happen on fast timescales otherwise we would not observe this larger quenching for lower green powers.


Using higher than 575nm does not excited either the NV0 or NV- and so charge state transfer can not occur and has not been probed. 
Whilst the >575nm laser cant excite the NV0 transition there is no reason why it can not excite the electron into the NV0 from the valance band and recombine it into NV-.

In this way it is possible for the longer wavelenths to contribute to another ionisation, recombination process as long as there is another laser exciting the transition:

All of these effects were investigated in an array of models and an Aikike statistical criteria was used to identify the model with the highest liklihood.

From here it appears that we can have a few things. Look into the supplementary material for each model anf their liklihoods.

Interestingly the model that showed the highest likelhood function was model 13 that showed a 50:50 recombination process with a 100% ms=0 rate that whilst were unconstrained values
agreed strongly with the current understanding of the NV centre. Additionally there was a spin dependant ionisation process with ~10x higher rate from +-1 than from zero:
??? Could be explained by 10x increase in dephasing observe when NV- is in its excited state.
From the rates one can also investigate the fitted spin and charge state polarisations. These were ~97% and ~70% which agree with are consistent with previous measurements

As the NIR laser is increased the charge state of the NV is flipping faster and faster losing the fluorescence from the nanodiamond.


Need to validate the 1.8 between NV0 and NV-
